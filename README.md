# Landing-Page
A landing page sample that I built while I was pursuing The Odin Project's curriculum. This project is a sample landing page built using HTML and CSS. It serves as a demonstration of basic web development skills and showcases the ability to create an attractive and responsive landing page layout.

# Features
- Responsive Design: The landing page is designed to adapt to various screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Modern Layout: The page incorporates modern design principles, utilizing clean typography, appealing visuals, and an intuitive user interface.
- HTML and CSS: The project is implemented using HTML for structuring the content and CSS for styling and layout purposes.
- Customizable: The codebase is easy to understand and modify, allowing developers to customize the landing page to their specific needs or integrate it into larger projects.

# Usage
To use this sample landing page, simply click [here](https://jadbizri.github.io/Landing-Page/){:target="_blank"}. Alternatively, you can simply download the code and open the index.html file in a web browser. Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different modifications to see the impact on the page layout and styling.
