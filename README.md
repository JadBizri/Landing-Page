# Landing-Page
A landing page sample that I built while I was pursuing The Odin Project's curriculum. This project is a sample landing page built using HTML and CSS. It serves as a demonstration of basic web development skills and showcases the ability to create an attractive and responsive landing page layout.

# Features

- HTML and CSS: The project is implemented using HTML for structuring the content and CSS for styling and layout purposes.
- Customizable: The codebase is easy to understand and modify, allowing developers to customize the landing page to their specific needs or integrate it into larger projects.
